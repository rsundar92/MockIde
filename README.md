This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** (v18.17.0 or later) - Download from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v9.x or later) - npm is included with Node.js.
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing the project files.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsundar92/MockIde.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MockIde

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install

   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev

   bun dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`**: Runs the app in development mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
